for special issue:

	* write about V_3, V_4, etc doesn't work - assumes long fixed chains

	
random crap:
	* retake issue
		* keep internal count of taken actions, separate from model to identify retake language

	* one-step probability of action becoming recommended
		* like occupation frequency (kahn & poupart) but for actions
		* use to filter afdv explanations

	* add retake language to concept base

	* More explicit model checking?
		* checking current state against goal state and explaining what's left to do?
